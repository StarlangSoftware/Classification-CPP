# Classification

## Classification Algorithms

1. Dummy: All test instances are assigned to the class with the maximum prior.
2. C45: The archetypal decision tree method.
3. Knn: K-Nearest Neighbor classification algorithm that uses the Euclidean distance.
4. Rocchio: Nearest-mean classification algorithm that uses the Euclidean distance.
5. Linear Perceptron: Linear perceptron with softmax outputs trained by gradient-descent to minimize cross-entropy.
6. Multi Layer Perceptron: Well-known multilayer perceptron classification algorithm.
7. Naive Bayes: Classic Naive Bayes classifier where each feature is assumed to be Gaussian distributed and each feature is independent from other features.
8. RandomForest: Random Forest method improves bagging idea with randomizing features at each decision node and called these random decision trees as weak learners. In the prediction time, these weak learners are combined using committee-based procedures.
